#   @integration  :   Integration that can work without config  ;)
#   @description  :   'identify' a set of integrations
#   @basic concept: 
#       During configuration splitt and cleanup - it came apparent that  
#       some integration actually had no requirement for configuration, 
#       so I just happened to clarify that by adding them in this 'config'
#     
#      I guess the logic is that they are activated whenever used  
#      and you can reconfigure if needed ?    
#      So this file is not adding any functionality - it is only describing
#      functionality HA enables magically ;)
#      Anyway - it's not broke, don't poke!
#      No worries, just my OCD that needed to make some sence of how things work
#
#      PS; list of active integrations are present in GUI
#          configurations/settings/info/integrations    (scroll down)

*** Integrations automagically working without any configuration:


recorder            - database-entries of state-changes?
                    - https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder
                    - not a part of default_config, but enabled automagically
                    - gues it's just such an crutial part of HA that 
                    - it is not possible to disable
                    - can be reconfigured by adding recorder.yaml


integration         - Riemann sum integral
                    - integration propably builtin/activated by first sensor using it?
                    - used as platform in a sensor 


systemmonitor       - sensor platform allows you to monitor disk usage, 
                    - memory usage, CPU usage, and running processes.


uptime              - The uptime sensor stores the timestamp (date and time) 
                      when Home Assistant was last started.
