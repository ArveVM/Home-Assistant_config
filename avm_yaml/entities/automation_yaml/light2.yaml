# AVM: YEO means Yaml Editable Only;  
#       theese files are added as 'list' to configuration 
#       therefore we must use -2 spaces for indentation,
#       and not start with a '-' on the ID
#
#       use one file for each automation
#
#       use 'yeo_' as prefix on alias,, that way you will know this
#       is an YEO-automation when you see it in Configuration/Automations
